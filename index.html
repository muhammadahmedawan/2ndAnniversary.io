                    <p>I known each other since childhood. We were cousins, but since we lived in different countries, we had never had the chance to get to know each other better.
                        That all changed in June 2020 when Faiza's family came to Pakistan from America for a visit. We all gathered together, and I finally had the chance to get to know her. We talked, laughed and shared stories about our lives. She was a sweet, kind and intelligent girl and I was drawn to her immediately.
                        I spent more than 15 days with her family as a family member, but the last week together was different in a sense to collect more memories, enjoying each other's company. We had so much fun, and I realized that I had developed feelings for her and family as well. 
                        Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic struck, and there were very few flights available for Faiza and her family to travel back to America. So, they had to leave Pakistan earlier than planned. I was devastated that they had to go. 
                        Faiza and I kept in touch after they left, and over time, my feelings for her grew stronger. Eventually, our families agreed to let us be married, and we started planning our wedding.
                        We were married in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by our families and friends. We looked back on those 7 days (a week) we spent together in Pakistan and smiled. We knew that our love story had begun there, and it was only fitting that we got married in the same country.
                        We look forward to many more years of happiness together, and we will never forget those days in June 2020 that changed our lives forever.</p>

                    <p>It was a beautiful spring day when my wife and I decided to go on a trip to the beautiful Swat Valley in Pakistan. We had heard so much about the breathtaking natural beauty of the hills, rivers and snow-covered mountains, and we couldnâ€™t wait to experience it for ourselves.

We started our journey in Kalam, and we were amazed by the lush green valleys and majestic mountains. We continued our journey to Malamjaba and Mengora City, where we were able to explore the local culture and traditions.

The beauty of the mountains and the fresh air were mesmerizing. We spent our days hiking and exploring the natural wonders of the area, and our evenings sitting around the fire with the locals, listening to stories about their culture and history.

It was an incredible experience, and we were so thankful to Allah for blessing us with the opportunity to see such beauty. We spent a whole week in Swat Valley and it was one of the most memorable trips we have ever taken.</p>

We remembered the first time we had moved into our home and all the dreams we had for our future. We had faced many challenges along the way, but we had always stuck together and supported each other.

We thanked Allah for His blessings and for giving us the strength to overcome any obstacle. We were so blessed to have each other and to have been able to spend two wonderful years together. Alhumdulillah.</p>

							It was 19 March 2021, and the day had finally arrived. After many months of planning, the moment we had been waiting for was about to happen. We had gathered at the masjid after Jumma Namaz for our nikkah. It was a beautiful ceremony, full of love and joy.
As we exchanged our vows of love and commitment, we felt a deep connection that could not be denied. We were two individual souls, now becoming one. It was an incredible moment that we would never forget.The love and support of our families, friends and the community was overwhelming.
We were so thankful and blessed to have such a strong support system. As we made our way out of the masjid, we felt a new sense of happiness and peace. We knew that we were now bound together as one, and that we would face all of lifeâ€™s challenges together. We were so thankful to Allah for blessing us with this wonderful journey, and we looked forward to a life full of love and joy.

                            <p>
							On 21 March 2021, the time had come for us to begin our new life together. I was so excited and a little bit nervous as I went to the brideâ€™s house to bring the barat.

We were welcomed with open arms and showered with love and blessings from the brideâ€™s family. Everyone was so happy and cheerful, and it was truly a memorable experience.

We finally made our way to our home, where our families and friends had gathered to celebrate our union. It was an incredibly special moment and we were so thankful to Allah for all His blessings.

We thanked everyone for their love and support, and we looked forward to beginning our married life together. Alhumdulillah, it has been an amazing journey so far and we are so grateful to be together.
